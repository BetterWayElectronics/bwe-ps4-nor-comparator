Hello!

Don't trust my PS4 NOR Validator? Have a whole bunch of dumps from the various consoles you have been repairing/collecting? Well now is your chance to shine!
I present to you the BwE PS4 NOR Comparator! Now you can gather vital information from all of your dumps at once and compare them all by yourself!

Be sure to use Notepad++ as the outputs can be large enough to crash your normal text editor. Oh and a multi-cored PC would help.

I think at this point I am finding excuses to release stuff...

Version History:
1.1 (20/01/19) - Whoops! Fixed a bug. Added Additional Comparison.
1.0 (19/01/19) - First Release!
